SLAB
====

WARNING: READ THIS FIRST
------------------------
This software is in BETA stage.
While more stable than alpha, bugs may still exist.
Feedback is welcome.

WHAT IS SLAB?
-------------
SLAB is a high-performance tiling window manager extension for GNOME Shell.
It adheres to an "Actor-First" philosophy: visual updates happen instantly
via the compositor, without waiting for the window manager protocol.
This results in zero-latency, glitch-free tiling.

It implements a simple Master-Stack layout:
- Master window on the left.
- Stack of windows on the right.

INSTALLATION
------------
Requirements: GNOME Shell 45+ (mainly targeted at Fedora 43 / GNOME 49)
Dependencies: TypeScript (for building), zip (for packaging)

Download release from GitHub or:

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/szymonwilczek/slab.git

2. Run the build script:
   ./build.sh

3. Install:
   cp -r dist/* ~/.local/share/gnome-shell/extensions/slab@slab.dev/

4. Enable:

HOW TO USE
----------
- Toggle Tiling: [Super] + [Shift] + [T]
  (This takes the current MONITOR and tiles it instantly)
